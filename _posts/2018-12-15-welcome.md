Longtime consumer of words, first time creator of words. 

In the words of the immortal Shea Serrano, it's time to shoot my shot. 

If you're reading this and it remains a GitHub blog with an orderedlist theme, I want to thank (and apologize) to Genevi√®ve Smith. I love the feel of your site so I mirrored your page to familiarize myself with GitHub. I have a few Wix pages in the works, but I needed to bite the bullet and start writing.

We hear a lot about the future. Fully distributed teams evangelize their tech stacks which promote all hands across a dozen time zones. 
With a motivated team working towards a common vision, you can achieve anything. I applaud these organizations, as I still regularly have to chase down once/week employees to respond to their Slack messages or mark themselves away.
